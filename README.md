# Welcome To The Ruby Ice Cream Shop App!

This CLI CRUD App was created in Ruby, accessing Sqlite3 Database using ActiveRecord.
It was really fun to build and is a work in progress.

## User Stories

In this app, the user can do the following things:

1. Enter your name when prompted.
2. Choose an ice cream shop.
3. Order an ice cream cone, by choosing the following:
   - ice cream flavor
   - cone type
   - number of scoops
4. If you are unsatisfied with your order--you can order a new cone, 
   and the old cone will be destroyed.
   
5. Once you have completed your order, 
   you will receive a nice message from the shop owner.
   
## Stretch Goals--Future Expansion

In this app, the user can do the following things:

1. Alternately, once you have completed your order, 
   you might randomly be assigned a mishap--where something terrible will happen to your ice cream cone.
   
2. If what you have ordered is out of stock, you will have the ability
   to make a new order.

## Instructions For Using This App

1. In your terminal, clone the github repo of this app.
2. Change directory to the project directory.
3. Run ruby run.rb
4. Have fun!

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank all of the people who gave me advice along the way, 
and helped me work through things. There are too many to list!

I would also like to thank google.com for it's endless supply of knowledge, whether it be succinct and understandable, or the exact opposite.

This app is dedicated to my son, Ari--who loves ice cream cones.
