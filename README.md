# Welcome To The Ruby Ice Cream Shop App!

This CLI CRUD App was created in Ruby, accessing Sqlite3 Database using ActiveRecord.
It was really fun to build and is a work in progress.

## User Stories

In this app, the user can do the following things:

1. Enter your name when prompted.
2. Choose an ice cream shop.
3. Order an ice cream cone, by choosing the following:
   - ice cream flavor
   - cone type
   - number of scoops
4. If you are unsatisfied with your order,
   you can start over and order a new cone.
   
5. Once you have completed your order, 
   you will receive a nice message from the shop owner.
   
## Stretch Goals--Future Expansion

In this app, the user can do the following things:

1. Alternately, once you have completed your order, 
   you might randomly be assigned a mishap--where something terrible will happen to your ice cream cone.
   
2. If what you have ordered is out of stock, you will have the ability
   to make a new order.
   
For my son's sake, I'd like to add some flashy heavily pixelated graphics and old-fashioned arcade music!

## Instructions For Using This App

1. In your terminal, clone the github repo of this app.
2. Change directory to the project directory.
3. Run ruby run.rb
4. Have fun!

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank all of the people who gave me advice along the way, 
and helped me work through things. That includes many of the students, as well as teachers in my cohort. THANK YOU ALL.

I would also like to thank google.com for it's endless supply of knowledge, whether it be succinct and understandable, or the exact opposite.

This app is dedicated to my Pa--who never stopped believing in me, and to my son Ari--who loves ice cream cones.
